Knights Of Kamand Our Plan is to build a web application, by the means of which we wish to stop loss of medicines due to their expiration and make it economically available for the weaker section of the society. From, our web app what we intend to do, is to sell medicines which are about to expire, to the user at a price lower than their MRP, by using a specific algorithm which will estimate the price of the medicine depending upon the expiry date, quantity, demand of medicine and Customer's review about dealer. In this way. we will possibly be able to provide medicines to the poor at a lower cost than the actual one. This web app will also lower the amount of medicines that are being wasted due to expiration, which indeed will give profit to the customer, retailer, company and even the owner of the web app, i.e. us. This will save environment as well as raw materials.
EXPANSIONS:

Recommendation of the medicines having similar active ingredient so that the same benefit can be obtained at lesser price.
Recommendation of medicines based on the illness(artificial doctor).
